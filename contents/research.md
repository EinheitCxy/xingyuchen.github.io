#### Machine Learning Model Development — Fudan University  
Researcher | Mentor: Prof. Junliang Zhang — Jun 2023 – Jun 2024

- Designed and tuned an MLP architecture (layers/neurons/activations) for chemical reaction selectivity prediction.
- Performed hyperparameter search (learning rate, batch size, regularization) and cross-validation for model selection.
- Built a model to predict product ratios with **R² = 0.87**.

#### Quantitative Financial Analysis — Fudan–Stanford Institute for China Fintech  
Research Assistant | Mentor: Prof. Qingfu Liu — Sep 2024 – Jan 2025

- Scraped and curated content about U.S. political figures from news and fact-checking sources.
- Built a political misinformation/news index and analyzed its correlation with financial markets.
- Used NLP + ML to incorporate political factors into stock return prediction (working paper).

#### Multimodal Diffusion Large Models — Fudan University × Alibaba  
Researcher | Supervisor: Dr. Baojian Zhou — Jul 2025 – Present

- Designed model architecture to map multimodal data (images, PDFs, audio, scientific data) into latent space.
- Improved training stability with noise scheduling and curriculum learning for better convergence.
- Studied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) interpretability and reasoning stability; explored model fusion for cost/performance tradeoffs.
